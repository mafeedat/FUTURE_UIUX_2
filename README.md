# FUTURE_UIUX_2

As part of my UI/UX learning journey, I designed Serinify, a mental wellness app focused on supporting mind peace through gentle habit tracking and emotional awareness.

🔍 What I worked on:
* Designed a calm, habit-first home screen with mood check-ins and quick calm actions
* Built a gentle habit tracking system for Sleep, Water, and Movement
* Designed an Add Habit flow with categorized, behavior-based habits and a custom option
* Created activity detail screens for clear daily and weekly tracking
* Designed an Insights screen focused on patterns and reflection rather than performance
* Developed a navigation system that separates quick logging from habit creation
* Used supportive microcopy to avoid pressure, guilt, and streak anxiety

📘 What I learned:
* How emotional safety impacts UX decisions in wellness products
* Why behavior-focused habits work better than outcome-driven goals
* How reducing choice overload improves consistency
* The importance of pairing data with reassurance
* How color, language, and hierarchy influence mental peace

💡 Key Insight:
 Designing for mental wellness is not about tracking more — it’s about helping users slow down, reflect, and build habits that feel supportive rather than demanding.
